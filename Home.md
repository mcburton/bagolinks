# Bag O Links

This project began as an experiment with [Penflip](http://penflip.com), an online writing tool that is backed by [Git](http://git-scm.com/). The site desires to be "GitHub for writers" and I think it has the potential to be so, but that is a different story.

The project I started was a single [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) document collecting links to various resources I've been coming across the Internets. Some of the links are things I've opened up in browser tabs and haven't had a chance to read, others are good articles I've read and want to quickly find again. 

The problem with penflip is the site was designed for writing. Penflip has two kinds of projects, single document and books, my bag of links fits neither. My document is beginning to get rather long and its organization difficult. There are several sections divided by header tags, I need a method of quickly navigating to the proper section to find links and add links in the correct space. A wiki, I think, might be a better way of organizing these links (I could be wrong, but I've got an interesting idea up my sleeve). After reading [a Hackernews discussion about Git as a datastore](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7015746) I was reminded about the [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum) wiki system used on GitHub. Gollum is interesting for two reasons. One, it can use markdown for its syntax and two, it is backed by git. 

Gollum has [a very lightweight directory structure and syntax](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki) and as such can be easily edited using plain text editors or (and here is the interesting part) maybe even fancy git-powered markdown writing tools...like Penflip!

Ok, I had to delete the bagolinks document project and create a new book project. Now I'm going to try and push this repository up... we'll see what happens...
