# My bag of links

because I don't really like bookmarks or, I've recently decided, I don't like bookmarking services linke pinboard, I'm going to use this to save links. Why this, I like the unstructuredness of a document.

## autosaving changes from Chrome Developer Console
I was dorking around with derrida.js in the chome developer console when I was building [pomo.io](http://pomo.io) and I notice Chrome has a menu item to "save" changes to javascript (and HTML/CSS I presume). While it (obviously) doesn't appear you can save back to remote locations (without some server shit in place), you can save local files. I'll have to play with this more. [this blog post "Auto-saving CSS And JavaScript Changes Locally From The Chrome Developer Tools" has a video and more information.](http://addyosmani.com/blog/autosave-changes-chrome-dev-tools/)
