# My bag of links

because I don't really like bookmarks or, I've recently decided, I don't like bookmarking services linke pinboard, I'm going to use this to save links. Why this, I like the unstructuredness of a document.

## IPython Notebooks & Publishing HN discussion
[HN thread on first chapter of Mining the Social Web as IPython Notebook](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6611848)  
some links Mathias put in the thread comments  
- [how to use nbconvert](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/Carreau/posts/master/06-NBconvert-Doc-Draft.ipynb)  
- [Github Issues thread about adding JATS support to nbconvert](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/4119)

## autosaving changes from Chrome Developer Console
I was dorking around with derrida.js in the chome developer console when I was building [pomo.io](http://pomo.io) and I notice Chrome has a menu item to "save" changes to javascript (and HTML/CSS I presume). While it (obviously) doesn't appear you can save back to remote locations (without some server shit in place), you can save local files. I'll have to play with this more. [this blog post "Auto-saving CSS And JavaScript Changes Locally From The Chrome Developer Tools" has a video and more information.](http://addyosmani.com/blog/autosave-changes-chrome-dev-tools/)


## post-modern programming
when dreaming up [pomo.io](http://pomo.io) i was googling around for information about the post-modern web and post-modern programming. i found [this link with some thoughts/notes on what post modern programming should be.](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PostModernProgramming.html)

## Scholarly Markdown
[Citations in Scholarly Markdown blog post with a **lot** of good discussion in the comments.](http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/19/citations-in-scholarly-markdown/) That link has the best discussion about citations in markdown I've seen so far. Here is [another post from that same blog "What is Scholarly Markdown"](http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/17/what-is-scholarly-markdown/) Also a [PLOSOne post about scholarly markdown, which I've just found but haven't read.](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/12/13/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/). 

[Github repository for the Scholarly Markdown project](https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki). I'm not sure where this is going and it doesn't look like it has been updated in a while.

[RTF/ODF-Scan for Zotero is a lightweight markup format for expressing zotero citations in ascii text. The scanner picks them up from teh document and replaces them with citations.](http://zotero-odf-scan.github.io/zotero-odf-scan/) I think Frank Bennet pointed this to me on twitter I was thinking about implementing this with my [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) zotero workflow/plugin.



## A pile of machine learning links
[word2vec does soemthing to compute the distance between words in a corpus of text](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/) it is being used by [ThisPlusThat.me](http://thisplusthat.me/) to do some cute Thing - trait + trait comparisons.
